## Reverse engineer BeReal API

My reverse engineered BeReal API can be found here: [beRealApi.json](server/src/openApiClients/beRealApi.json)

It was written out by hand from decompiled BeReal android app.

Thanks to [notmarek/BeFake](https://github.com/notmarek/BeFake) for providing insomnia config <https://github.com/notmarek/BeFake/blob/master/insomnia.json>, it's a great starting point to fiddle with BeReal API.
